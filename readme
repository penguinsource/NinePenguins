places where you have to change the ip in order for it to work..

public/angularApp/controllers/mainController.js
public/angularApp/services/NineCache.js
app.js (init function, setting the port to listen on)


if you have an ipv6 ip address, type it in browser as such:

ip address: 2601:589:2:5fc0:f959:f5dd:5932:49be
port number: 3000

type: [2601:589:2:5fc0:f959:f5dd:5932:49be]:3000
