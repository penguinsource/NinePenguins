me placing/moving/flying a pin:

===== CLIENT SIDE ======

- first of all, the server will update me with my state (place, move or fly)

- update gui actions:
	(Extra)- if i'm grabbing a pin and hovering it over other pin indices, 'shadow' those spots
			 if i can actually place my pin there 
			 	(for state place, shadow any pin index i hover my mouse over, IF i can place my pin on that index)
			 	(for state move, i can either select a pin, and neighbours where i can place my pin should be shadowed
			 					OR i can grab a pin and neighbours where i can place my pin should be shadowed)
			 	(for state fly, there might be no need to shadow anything, as there are too many indices to shadow ?? not sure yet.)


(PART 1) :

-check if its my turn
-check if target pin index is available (DEPRECATED ****))

-triage by current state (place, move, fly or remove)

if place
	check if target pin index is available
	check if i have enough pins left to place
	place pin
	decrease pins left to place
	if current user moved the pin // this might be deprecated
		update server
	function check for mill
		if a mill occured
			it's still current (my turn) player's turn
			change current state to remove
		else
			function check game winning conditions
	(NOT REQUIRED, but nice feature to update the client side: )
		check # of pins left to place, if it's 0, set state to move (NOT REQUIRED as the server will update my state the next turn)
	
else if move
	check if target pin index is available
	check if source element (the index im moving the pin from) belongs to me
	check if its a valid move (the target pin is the neighbour of the source pin)
	move pin
	if current user moved the pins// this might be deprecated
		update server
	function check for mill
		if a mill occured
			it's still current (my turn) player's turn
			change current state to remove
		else
			function check game winning conditions

else if fly
	check if target pin index is available
	check if source element belongs to me
	function check for mill
		if a mill occured
			it's still current (my turn) player's turn
			change current state to remove
		else
			function check game winning conditions

else if remove
	check if the target pin index belongs to the other player
	remove their pin
	if current user removed the pins// this might be deprecated
		update server
	function check game winning conditions (removeAction = true)

-----

function check for mill
	- if i made a mill, let me remove one of the other players' pin
	  (conditions: )
	(nice feature to have:)
		- if i hover over my opponents' pin, it should turn red-ish if the pin is removable

function check game winning conditions (removeAction boolean)
	if (removeAction is true)
		- if the other player has < 3 pins, i win
	- check if the other player can move any pin.. if they cant, i win
	- (DO NOT CHECK conditions if i lost the game.. updates on my current state 
	   will be updated everytime i receive data from the server)

-----

handling server calls:
	place, move or fly
		receive updates from server 
			update local game object board
			update current state
			move pin
			if a mill occured, server should update and tell me the 3 pins (should highlight them on the board)
			if a player won the game, server should update and tell me..
	remove
		receive updates from server
			update local game object board
			update current state
			remove pin
			if a player won the game, server should update and tell me..

(PART 2) :

This part is about handling calls from the server, and updating the client-side game object as well as the GUI.
every call needs to receive:
	{gameid, playerTurn, actionType(place, move, fly, remove, win, lose), targetIndex, sourceIndex}

- check to see if the client side gameid matches the gameid received. if it doesnt, print error
- follow the steps in (PART 1).. 
  basically, the game will wait for my user input (placing/	  moving pins.. etc)

- Triage by actionType

===== SERVER SIDE ======

Sending from client to server:

every call needs to receive:
	{authentication (.., .., userid) , gameid, playerTurn, actionObject(actionType (place, move, fly, remove), targetIndex, sourceIndex) }

- get game object using the received gameid (if no game object found or game is not active, return error)
- check to see if the userid is one of the players defined in the game object (else return error).
- check to see if its userid's turn to play

- triage by action Type: (check that the action type received from user matches action type set in the game object)

case place
	- check if target pin index is available
	- check if current user has enough pins left to place another one; 
	    - return error if not, cause the current user should not be in 'place' state if they dont have any pins left to place
	- place pin, decrease the pins left to be placed
	- function check for mill
		if mill occured
			keep same player's turn (player A)
			update the other player (player B) by sending him the placed pin index, and current player turn
			player A gameState = remove, playerTurn = A's id
			emit "placePin:" to the other player (B)
			{gameId, playerid, playerState, pinIndex, playerTurn}
		else if no mill occured
			player turn = player B (the other player)
			check game winning conditions
				if game won:
					gameState = "end"
					emit "placePin": {gameId, playerid, pinIndex, playerTurn, gameState, message}
				else:
					if the current user has 0 pins left to place, set gameState to 'move'
					emit "placePin": {gameId, playerid, pinIndex, playerTurn, gameState, newMill}
	
	- send update to both players

case move
	- check if target pin index is available
	- check if the source pin index belongs to the current user
	- check if its a valid move (the target pin is the neighbour of the source pin)
	- move pin (that means update game obj board)
	- function check for mill
		- if a mill occured, send message to both players letting them know
		  one of them made a mill. keep the same player's turn
		  Need a way that keeps track of when the server is waiting for a player to remove a pin; return
	- check game winning conditions
		- if a player won game, announce both, return;
	- send update to both players

case fly
	(NO NEED) - idk if i should check if the current user has 3 pins left.. 
	should make sure there is no way to get to fly mode without making sure user only has 3 pins left.
	- check if the target pin index is availabl
ered	- check if the source pin index belongs to the current user
	- fly pin
	-function check for mill
		- if a mill occured, send message to both players letting them know one of them made a mill.
		  keep the same player's turn.
		  Need a way that keeps track of when the server is waiting for a player to remove a pin; return
	- function check game winning conditions 2 (it shouldnt check if the player has < 3 pins)
		- if a player won game, announce both, return;
	- send update to both players

case remove
	- check that the pin index selected to be removed (targetIndex) belongs 
	  to the other player (so not the one whois current turn it is)
	- check if its a valid move (if all pins on the board are in mills, then it 
	  can be deleted. if targetIndex is in a mill but there are other pins that aren't, return error, player should pick another pin)
	- remove pin
	- function check game winning conditions
		- if a player won game, announce both, return;
	- if the player has 
	- send update to both players


function check for mill
	- if i made a mill, let me remove one of the other players' pin
	  (conditions: )
	(nice feature to have:)
		- if i hover over my opponents' pin, it should turn red-ish if the pin is removable

// removeAction Boolean is true if this function is called after the player has removed a pin 
function check game winning conditions (param removeAction Boolean)
	- if (removeAction)
		if the other player has < 3 pins, you win !
	- check if the other player can move any pin.. if they cant, i win
		- check this by their playerState:
			- for place state and fly, return true
			- for place move, go through each element on the board that belongs
			  to this player and check to see if their neighbour element is empty. if it is, return true
			  else return false;


****************
Think about cases where check game winning conditions doesnt need to check if 
the other player has < 3 pins.. sometimes its unnecessary
